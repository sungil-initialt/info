Man-in-the-middle attackers can manipulate networks to serve their own keys, thereby compromising any communication.


Publicly-trusted PKIs, which are trusted by the browsers, must conform to RFC 5280, which requires the use of the X.509 v3 format. X.509 v3 allows certificates to include additional data, such as usage constraints or policy information, as extensions. 


Each of these extensions is either critical or non-critical, with browsers being required to process and validate all critical ones.	


Browsers check that a certificate’s issuer field is the same as the subject field of the previous certificate in the certificate path.


when the upstream Internet service provider was replaced, but could not route the networks address space.


The hidden addresses are changed into a single (public) IP address as the source address of the outgoing IP packets so they appear as originating not from the hidden host but from the routing device itself


This method enables communication through the router only when the conversation originates in the private network since the initial originating transmission is what establishes the required information in the translation tables.


Data encapsulation is also done at this layer. The sender end and the receiving end should be in synchronization and the transmission rate in the form of bits per second is also decided at this layer.
	-transmission rate in the form of bits per second : 비트버 세컨드 형태의 전송률


Ethernet switch manufacturers often tout that their switches use cut-through switching rather than store-and-forward packet switching, used by routers and bridges.
	 -used by routers and bridges : 라우터나 브릿지가 이용하듯


When the packet arrives, there may or may not be other packets in the outbound link's output buffer. When there are packets in the output buffer, there is absolutely no difference between store-and-forward and cut-through switching. The two switching techniques only differ when the output buffer is empty.
	-there may or may not be : 있을수도 없을수도 있다.

When it arrives, the IP layer hands it back to the TCP layer, which reassembles the packets into the message and hands it to the email application, where it shows up in the Inbox.
	-the IP layer hands it back to the TCP layer : IP레이어는 그것을 뒤쪽 TCP레이어로 넘긴다.
